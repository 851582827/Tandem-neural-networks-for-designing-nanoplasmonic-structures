# Tandem-neural-networks-for-designing-nanoplasmonic-structures
This repository contains the code and data for the design and optimization of nanoplasmonic structures using tandem neural networks. The method combines forward and inverse modeling to efficiently design nanostructures with desired optical properties.

Due to the large size of the dataset containing 150,000 LDOS entries (exceeding 1GB), there is currently no efficient way to directly upload it to the GitHub repository. Readers can generate the dataset themselves using the 'getTrainData_all.m' file available in the project's Matlab files. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
